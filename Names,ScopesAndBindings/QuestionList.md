2. Can scopes nest?Are they open or closed?
3. Does the scope of a name encompass the entire block in which it is declared, or only the portion after the declaration?
4. How does one declare mutually recursive types or subroutines? 
5. Can subroutines be passed as parameters, returned from functions, or stored in variables? If so, when are referencing environments bound?
